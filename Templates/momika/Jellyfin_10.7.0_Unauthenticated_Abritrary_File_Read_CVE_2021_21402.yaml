  impact: <p>Attackers can read arbitrary files to obtain sensitive information of
    the server<br></p>
  description: Jellyfin is a Free Software Media System. In Jellyfin before version
    10.7.1, with certain endpoints, well crafted requests will allow arbitrary file
    read from a Jellyfin server's file system. This issue is more prevalent when Windows
    is used as the host OS. Servers that are exposed to the public Internet are potentially
    at risk. This is fixed in version 10.7.1. As a workaround, users may be able to
    restrict some access by enforcing strict security permissions on their filesystem,
    however, it is recommended to update as soon as possible.
